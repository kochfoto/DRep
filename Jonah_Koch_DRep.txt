This is a test DRep invocation certificate for Jonah Koch.  Iâ€™m focusing my DRep representation on universal suffrage for all Cardano Community Members to participate in the protocol.  I will resist any contingency policies that will degrade the open fair access for all to all aspects of the L1 technology.  I believe that spreading power to the edges is the best way to insulate our ecosystem from soft capture my the deep pockets of nation states and international conglomerates of open permission-less systems.  This is to ensure the resilience and longevity of the Cardano blockchain.
